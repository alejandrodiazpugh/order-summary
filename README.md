### What I learned

This was the first project I ever undertook for FrontEndMentor, around 6 months ago. At the time, I was scared to show any answers because I thought my code would be "unoptimal", and while that may be the case, at the end of the day everyone starts somewhere. 

Since I started this, I've learned a lot about UX/UI, programming in JS, using libraries/frameworks like React and Svelte, and some backend. While this project ain't all that difficult, and I think there are some sizing issues still, I'm still posting it as a testament of where I began.




### Continued development

I think a proper UI would have state changes, transitions, and maybe some animations on hover. There really isn't all that much here to discuss, as this is a simple static component, but I can see it within a bigger project as a nice touch.
